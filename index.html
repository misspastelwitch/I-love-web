    Hey there! I'm Stella, a 23 year old (aspiring) frontend designer based
    in the Netherlands. I've always been interested in design and aesthetics,
    and routinely find myself wishing websites were designed better. I hope
    that I can one day make people's experiences on the internet a little smoother,
    easier and prettier, because frankly there is not enough colour in the
    world.

        Outside of making things look pretty, my greatest passion is travelling.
        I love discovering new cultures & tasting all the delicious foods this
        world has to offer. My favourite place I have been to is Hong Kong, not
        only for its super cheap street food and famous neon lights, but also for
        its amazing hikes, islands and of course, beaches.

    At the moment I am working on using Javascript more to create a more seamless experience for the people who use my websites.
    This includes making reactive buttons, search features, and also fun animations. I've had a lot of fun with sketching out my ideas lately.
